A tkinter GUI video editor for moviepy

This is my attempt at a moviepy video editor using tkinter GUI - I uploaded it here so I can get feedback on how it looks.

To use you should be able to just run the 'main.py' script - (note: you will need to install modules such as moviepy as they aren't added in here)
